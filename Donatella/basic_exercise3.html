        <p>Coming out of my cage
            <br> And I've been doing just fine
            <br> Gotta gotta be down <br> Because I want it all <br> It started out with a kiss <br> How did it end up like this? <br> It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss <br> Now I'm falling asleep <br> And she's calling a cab <br> While he's having
            a smoke <br> And she's taking a drag <br> Now they're going to bed <br> And my stomach is sick <br> And it's all in my head <br> But she's touching his chest now <br> He takes off her dress now <br> Let me go <br> And I just can't look, it's
            killing me <br> And taking control</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <br> Swimming through sick lullabies <br> Choking on your alibis <br> But it's just the price I pay <br> Destiny is calling me <br> Open up my eager eyes <br> 'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
